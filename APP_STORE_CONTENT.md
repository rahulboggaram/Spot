## Support URL (required)

Use a real page that explains how to get help. If you don’t have a site yet, you can use:

**Option A – GitHub (if you host support there):**  
`https://github.com/rahulboggaram/GoldApp`  
(create a README or “Support” section with contact/FAQ)

**Option B – Simple hosted page:**  
`https://spot-app-bice.vercel.app`  
(Add a “Support” or “Contact” section to your web app, or a `/support` page that lists email/FAQ.)

“Spot – Gold & Silver Prices. For support, email: your-email@example.com. We’ll respond within 1–2 business days.”

## Privacy Policy URL (required)

Apple requires a dedicated privacy policy page. You need a URL that hosts your policy.

**If you don’t have one yet:**  
Create a single page (e.g. on your Vercel site or GitHub Pages) with a privacy policy. Example content you can adapt:

**Suggested URL:**  
`https://spot-app-bice.vercel.app/privacy`  
(or `https://yourusername.github.io/Spot/privacy` if using GitHub Pages)

**Minimal privacy policy text (customize and publish at the URL above):**

```

## Screenshots

Apple requires at least one screenshot per device size you support. For “Spot” you typically need:

| Device | Size (points) | Notes |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| 6.7" (e.g. iPhone 15 Pro Max) | 1290 x 2796 | Optional if you support this size |
| 6.5" (e.g. iPhone 14 Plus) | 1284 x 2778 | Optional |
| 5.5" (e.g. iPhone 8 Plus) | 1242 x 2208 | Common minimum |
| 5.5" (iPad Pro 12.9") if tablet | 2048 x 2732 | Only if “Supports iPad” is on |

**Minimum to ship:** At least one size for the largest iPhone you support (e.g. 6.7" or 6.5").

**What to capture:**

1. **Main screen** – Home with gold and silver cards (Physical or PCX), visible prices and any up/down indicators.  
2. **Widget** – Home screen with the Spot widget visible (optional but recommended).  
3. **Price history** – Price History screen with the chart for gold or silver.  

**How to capture:**

- Run the app in Simulator or on a device.  
- Take a screenshot (Cmd+S in Simulator, or side button + volume up on device).  
- Resize/crop to exact pixels if needed (e.g. with Preview or design tool).  
- Upload in App Store Connect → Version → Screenshots → select device size → add image.

**Tips:**

- Use light mode if that’s your main UI (your app is light-only).  
- Ensure prices and text are readable; avoid empty or “Loading…” as the main screenshot.  
- No need to add device frames unless you want; Apple can show them.
